### Whats up bud'? ðŸ‘‹
<br>


ðŸ’¼ I'm currently in my second year of training as a software developer in the age of 18.

âœ¨ My mainly interests and experience are in Typescript, React, React Native and Java. (smaller experience in Angular, Kotlin and C#)

ðŸ•› Until now, I developed smaller applications to improve my experience.

âš¡ Fun fact: I now like coffee (only from discounter lol)
