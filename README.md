### Whats up bud'? ğŸ‘‹
<br>


ğŸ’¼ I'm currently in my first year of training as a software developer in the age of 17.

âœ¨ My interests and experience are in Java and a litte in .net.

ğŸ”­ Until now, I developed smaller applications to improve my experience. Currently i'm working in my spare-time on an web-app to manage expenses.

âš¡ Fun fact: I dont like coffee
